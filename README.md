# Pig-Lattin-Translator

This is just a simple language translator that I worked on one and a half year into my college degree. There are a lot of things that can improved upon, but overall, I think it suits its purpose very well - As a coding practice that I can work on while having a faster way to communicate with my friends in a secret language.

The code works by pulling each individual word from the sentence out and modifying it to resemble a made up language called Pig Lattin with my friends and checks for commas, periods, question marks to make sure things are all grammartically correct. In addition, it checks for words that are already capitalized such as Names and retain that format.
